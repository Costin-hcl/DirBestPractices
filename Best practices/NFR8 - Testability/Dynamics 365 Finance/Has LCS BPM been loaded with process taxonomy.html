  <div class="description">
    <p>Loading the full list of processes that need to be supported by the implemented system in the LCS Business Process Modeler (BPM) makes testing easier as it defines the full scope and also provides a hierarchical grouping of scenarios to be implemented and tested.</p>

Test cases can then be linked to the user stories in order to track the completeness and status of testing against business requirements.</p>
