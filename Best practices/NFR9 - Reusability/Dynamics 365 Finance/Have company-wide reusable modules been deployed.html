  <div class="description">
    <p>When gaps are identified on a project, it's best practice to check if the needed functionality has already been implemented. This could be in:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft packages</li>
      <li>ISV packages</li>
      <li>Open-source projects</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>licensing </strong>and <strong>costs </strong>of reuse as well as the <strong>support </strong>and <strong>maintenance </strong>for any 3rd-party software need to be clearly understood before a decision is made to use them.</p>
    <p>In addition to external components, companies may&nbsp;use internal catalogs of products to enable code reuse.</p>
    <p>The key behaviors to keep in mind are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Before starting&nbsp;a development, check if the function has been implemented before</li>
      <li>After developing something that looks reusable, publish it either externally (e.g. GitHub) or internally</li>
      <li>Evangelize the internal products so that various departments in the company learn about the existing products</li>
      <li>In the sales process, ensure reusable products are taken into consideration if applicable&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
