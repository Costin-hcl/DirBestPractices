## Etiquette:
1. **Always say why** - Explain why something is best practice. Ensure the [five whys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) are either stated explictly or easily deducible. Ensure the link to project goals is provided (see [wiki](https://github.com/Costin-hcl/DirBestPractices/wiki) for matrix). See section *Why the current HTML format in GitHub repo was chosen?* as an example.

2. **Be clear and concise** - Best practices are not a place to write essays. Say what you need to say in as few words as possible. Be clear and **define terms** that may not be known by everyone, including acronyms.

3. **Always provide references** - If best practices are extracted from a documentation article or blog, provide the link. It's only fair to credit the original authors.

4. **No malarkey** - Keep only relevant and updated best practice entries, things that are actionable, things that have a real impact.


## Why the current HTML format in GitHub repo was chosen?
The goals we had in mind were:
- **Having a repository** (storage, change tracking) for best practices with explanations and links - GitHub is the de-facto standard and Microsoft property. Word documents on SharePoint were also an option, although change tracking is harder.
- **Ability to collaborate globally** - GitHub is better suited than SharePoint to collaborate cross-org. No licencing costs.
- **Ability to generate surveys automatically** - The file format needs to be easy to parse: HTML, Markdown, JSON good candidates.
- **Easy to edit, easy to parse** - HTML and Markdown both have plenty of open-source WYSIWYG editors. JSON not so much. HTML easier to parse for generating surveys and aggregating best practices in a printable or readable format.

So the best solution was HTML files stored on GitHub. If you have better suggestions that fit the goal, please get in touch.
